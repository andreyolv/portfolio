Summary of all my personal and original projects data science projects.

## Simple Projects:

[**(S1) Email WebScraping with Automatic IP Proxy Switching:**]()

Owning an excel spreadsheet containing a list of thousands of CNPJs of companies, a WebScraping was created using the Selenium tool to interact with the browser, insert the CNPJ of each company in the search field of a website, identify the company's email and copy to the spreadsheet. The website has a limit of searches per day per IP, so a proxy IP was used to change the access IP.
